Sixth week's assignments

### 1.1 Sequential circuits and ASM method

#### Since there is (_14_) stateboxes or states, we can calculate how many flip-flops (FF) we need:

__k__ = number of __flip-flops__ and __s__ = number of __states__   
$2^k \geq s$ _or_ $k \geq log_2(s)$

- $k \geq log_2(14)$
- $k \geq 3.8073$
- $k â‰ˆ 4$
- So atleast __4__ flip-flops are needed.   

The ASM chart shows that the system has (__4 unique__) output signals:
 - sis
 - ssis
 - ul
 - tul

The system is a __Moore__ state machine, because there are no conditional stateboxes.

### 1.2 ASM-chart clock cycle

#### So if the clock cycle time is (0.5 seconds) and the goal is for the motor to start after 2 seconds:

$\frac{Delay}{\text{Cycle time}} = \frac{2 (s)}{0.5 (s)} = 4$

Total amount of states needed is __4__, but since there is already a statebox (led) in the ASM-chart. Need to add __3 states__.
